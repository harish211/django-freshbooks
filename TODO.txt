Serializing Invoices (to be generified):

Invoice.create

Create an XML request document
Set the 'method' attribute
Loop over all fields of the object being serialized
	if field is an FK 
		ignore it	
	if field is a genericReverseFk
		get the name of the Model it references 
		add an element to the doc named after the field name (ie we should name reverse FKs appropriately)
			Loop over all objects in the reverseFK
				call serialize on each one and append the xml to the request doc
	else
		if field value is None:
			skip it
		if field name is id:
			add element named after model (ie invoice_id)
		else
			add an element named after the field name
